  <p>The intended function of the circle/triangle in the middle is served as a "play" button. Also, the "X" in the top right corner serves as the close out button to take you back to the main menu. Each of these buttons are clear to the user that you have two options, you can either play the movie or exit out to continue browsing. </p>

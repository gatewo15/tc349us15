Damani Gatewood's Resume
Printing resumes can be an inconvenience, and when you need to get someone your resume
on the go you have to wait until you are near your files so that you can send it as an email.
How great would it be if you could just send off a link to your resume in website form?
I plan on taking the actual page of my resume, adding my portfolio, and slight interactions
so that others can view my resume in website form, and also be able to click on my portfolio
straight from the link.
